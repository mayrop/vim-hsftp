=========

SFTP for Vim: Sync local and remote files/folders inside vim.

Config
------
Create a config file called `.hsftp` in the root of your projects directory.

Example `.hsftp` config file - the amount of spaces do not matter:

    host   example.org
    user   username
    pass   Sup3rS3cureP4s$W0rd
    port   22
    remote /var/www/
    auto_upload 1
    auto_download 0
    confirm_download 0
    confirm_upload 0


vim-hsftp searches up the current files (current buffers) directory path for a `.hsftp` config file, and assumes it is located at the projects root directory. This resembles how the SFTP plugin for Sublime Text 3 works.

e.g. if the local file in vim is located at `/example/dir/file.txt`, and the example config file shown above is located at `/example/.hsftp` - when you run `:Hupload`, vim-hsftp will upload the local file to the host `example.org` at the remote path `/var/www/dir/file.txt` via SFTP using the provided credentials.

Usage
------
Run the command or use the mapping in vim on the current file/current buffer.

**Upload File** 

Upload the current file (current buffer) to the remote path.
    
    :Hupload
    <leader>hsu

**Download File** 

Download the current file (current buffer) from the remote path.
    
    :Hdownload
    <leader>hsd

**Upload Folder** 

Upload all files in the current folder (current buffer) to the remote path.
    
    :Hupdir
    <leader>hsf

AsyncRun Support
------
Add this to your `.vimrc` (you will need to install the [AsyncRun](https://github.com/skywind3000/asyncrun.vim) plugin first).
```
let g:hsftp_asyncrun_enable = 1
```
